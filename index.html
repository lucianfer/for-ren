            <p>Dear Ren,</p>
            <p>I want to start by saying how deeply sorry I am for my actions. I betrayed your trust, and for that, I am truly sorry. You deserved honesty and loyalty, and I failed to give you that.</p>
            <p>There are no excuses for what I did, but please know that I am genuinely remorseful. I regret my actions every day and the pain I caused you. You are a wonderful person who didn't deserve to be hurt.</p>
            <p>I wish I could go back and change things, but I can't. All I can do now is offer my sincere apology and hope that one day you might find it in your heart to forgive me. I am committed to becoming a better person, and I am taking steps to ensure this never happens again.</p>
            <p>Thank you for the beautiful memories we shared. I will always cherish them and remember you with the respect and admiration you deserve.</p>
            <p>Sincerely,</p>
            <p>Ryu.</p>
